She has a light shining from the depth of her eyes\n
That makes you go blind or fall in love\n
She makes those sweet movements\n
That make you wild or turn you into a dog\n
And far away in her heart\n
Im sure she has to be from elsewhere\n
\n
She has this way of not saying anything\n
That speaks on the verge of memories\n
This way of walking across\n
When she goes to the butcher\n
When she arrives at my height\n
Im sure she has to be from elsewhere\n
\n
And Ive become a slave\n
Of this smile, of this face\n
And I tell her take me away\n
And Im ready to face the backwash\n
Heading for other place, other shores\n
But she doesnt answer\n
The words have no meaning for her\n
Im sure she has to be from elsewhere\n
\n
She has the subtle hands of a lace maker\n
That would cause the essence of a Vermeer to pale\n
This Venetian silhouette\n
When she leans towards her blinds\n
I know this movement by heart\n
Im sure she has to be from elsewhere\n
\n
And Ive become a slave\n
Of this smile, of this face\n
And I tell her take me away\n
And Im ready to face the backwash\n
Heading for other place, other shores\n
But she doesnt answer\n
Love has no meaning for her\n
Im sure she has to be from elsewhere\n
\n
And Ive become a slave\n
Of this smile, of this face\n
And I tell her take me away\n
And Im ready to face the backwash\n
Heading for other place, other shores\n
But she doesnt answer
